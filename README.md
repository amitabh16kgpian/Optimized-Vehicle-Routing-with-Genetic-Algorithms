# Optimized-Vehicle-Routing-with-Genetic-Algorithms

Vehicle Routing Problem Solver

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) solver using genetic algorithms (GA) and comparative analysis with the Nearest Neighbour Algorithm (NNA).

Key Features:

Genetic Algorithm (GA) Implementation: Engineered a robust GA to optimize VRP, achieving a 1.68x reduction in total route distance compared to the NNA.
Fitness Function Design: Devised a fitness evaluation function that minimized total distance and effectively balanced workload across vehicles, outperforming the NNA's route balance by approximately 1.32 times.
Visualization with Matplotlib: Utilized Matplotlib for clear and insightful visual representations of complex routing solutions, enhancing data communication and decision-making processes.
Usage:

Clone the repository and run main.py to execute the genetic algorithm and visualize the optimal route solution.
Experiment with different parameters and explore how the GA improves over the NNA in solving VRP instances.
Dependencies:

Python 3.x
DEAP
NumPy
Matplotlib
